# About me

As the founding AI product strategist, I led the full lifecycle from inception to scale—shaping strategy, designing features, driving QA, and contributing industry-recognized research. I combine deep domain expertise with growing technical fluency to ensure our tools meet analyst needs and evolve with the market.
Before LinqAlpha, I covered the internet sector at Goldman Sachs Equity Research and the petrochemical sector at Hana Securities.
